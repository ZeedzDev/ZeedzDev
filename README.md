### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hey! My name is **Zeedz** (he/him), I'm an Aussie Software Developer working on heaps of projects. Primarily using javascript and nodeJS, I enjoy learning new skills and trying new things out! 

Excited to improve my frontend development, I am a backend developer at heart. Seriously though, the frontend's that I work on look like a rat took a shit on the site... That's why I stick with backend & Discord Bot Development. ðŸ˜”
